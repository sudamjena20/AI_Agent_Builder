00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,620
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,200
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,360
A cold dip restores health and zest.

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,060
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,360
Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,500
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
